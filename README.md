Cricket Match Winner Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the winner of cricket matches based on various features like teams, venue, and host country.

Features
Preprocesses cricket data with one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Implements a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Evaluates model accuracy on a test dataset.

Requirements
Python 
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook file cricketdataset.ipynb.
Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Output
The trained model predicts match winners.
Accuracy metrics are displayed at the end of the notebook.
